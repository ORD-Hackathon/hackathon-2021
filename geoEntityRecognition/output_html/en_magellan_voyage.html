<p>The fleet left <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</a> on 20 September 1519, sailing west across the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q756267">Atlantic</a> toward <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18">South America</a>.
In December, they made landfall at <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8678">Rio de Janeiro</a>.
From there, they sailed south along the coast, searching for a way through or around the continent.
After three months of searching (including a false start in the estuary of Río de la Plata), weather conditions forced the fleet to stop their search to wait out the winter.
They found a sheltered natural harbor at the port of Saint Julian, and remained there for five months.
Shortly after landing at <span style="color: #ff0000">St. Julian</span>, there was a mutiny attempt led by the Spanish captains Juan de Cartagena, Gaspar de Quesada and Luis de Mendoza.
Magellan barely managed to quell the mutiny, despite at one point losing control of three of his five ships to the mutineers.
Mendoza was killed during the conflict, and Magellan sentenced <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q787675">Quesada</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3738">Cartagena</a> to being beheaded and marooned, respectively.
Lower-level conspirators were made to do hard labor in chains over the winter, but later freed.

During the winter, one of the fleet's ships, the Santiago, was lost in a storm while surveying nearby waters, though no men were killed.
Following the winter, the fleet resumed their search for a passage to the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a> in October 1520.
Three days later, they found a bay which eventually led them to a strait, now known as <span style="color: #ff0000">the Strait of Magellan</span>, which allowed them passage through to the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a>. While exploring the strait, one of the remaining four ships, the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q35278713">San Antonio</a>, deserted the fleet, returning east to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</a>.
The fleet reached the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a> by the end of November 1520. Based on the incomplete understanding of world geography at the time, Magellan expected a short journey to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48">Asia</a>, perhaps taking as little as three or four days. In fact, the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a> crossing took three months and twenty days.
The long journey exhausted their supply of food and water, and around 30 men died, mostly of scurvy. Magellan himself remained healthy, perhaps because of his personal supply of preserved quince.

On 6 March 1521, the exhausted fleet made landfall at the island of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16635">Guam</a> and were met by native Chamorro people who came aboard the ships and took items such as rigging, knives, and a ship's boat.
The Chamorro people may have thought they were participating in a trade exchange (as they had already given the fleet some supplies), but the crew interpreted their actions as theft.
Magellan sent a raiding party ashore to retaliate, killing several Chamorro men, burning their houses, and recovering the 'stolen' goods.
On 16 March, the fleet reached the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q928">Philippines</a>, where they would remain for a month and a half. Magellan befriended local leaders on the island of Limasawa, and on 31 March, held the first Mass in the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q928">Philippines</a>, planting a cross on the island's highest hill.
Magellan set about converting the locals to Christianity. Most accepted the new religion readily, but the island of <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q685318">Mactan</a> resisted.
On 27 April, Magellan and members of his crew attempted to subdue the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q685318">Mactan</a> natives by force, but in the ensuing battle, the Europeans were overpowered and Magellan was killed.

Following his death, Magellan was initially succeeded by co-commanders Juan Serrano and Duarte Barbosa (with a series of other officers later leading).
The fleet left the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q928">Philippines</a> (following a bloody betrayal by former ally Rajah Humabon) and eventually made their way to the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q31810388">Moluccas</a> in November 1521.
Laden with spices, they attempted to set sail for <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</a> in December, but found that only one of their remaining two ships, the Victoria, was seaworthy.
The Victoria, captained by Juan Sebastián Elcano, finally returned to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</a> by 6 September 1522, completing the circumnavigation. Of the 270 men who left with the expedition, only 18 or 19 survivors returned.
