The fleet left Spain on 20 September 1519, sailing west across the Atlantic toward South America.
In December, they made landfall at Rio de Janeiro.
From there, they sailed south along the coast, searching for a way through or around the continent.
After three months of searching (including a false start in the estuary of RÃ­o de la Plata), weather conditions forced the fleet to stop their search to wait out the winter.
They found a sheltered natural harbor at the port of Saint Julian, and remained there for five months.
Shortly after landing at St. Julian, there was a mutiny attempt led by the Spanish captains Juan de Cartagena, Gaspar de Quesada and Luis de Mendoza.
Magellan barely managed to quell the mutiny, despite at one point losing control of three of his five ships to the mutineers.
Mendoza was killed during the conflict, and Magellan sentenced Quesada and Cartagena to being beheaded and marooned, respectively.
Lower-level conspirators were made to do hard labor in chains over the winter, but later freed.

During the winter, one of the fleet's ships, the Santiago, was lost in a storm while surveying nearby waters, though no men were killed.
Following the winter, the fleet resumed their search for a passage to the Pacific in October 1520.
Three days later, they found a bay which eventually led them to a strait, now known as the Strait of Magellan, which allowed them passage through to the Pacific.
