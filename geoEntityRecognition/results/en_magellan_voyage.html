    <p>The fleet left <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</a> on 20 September 1519, sailing west across the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q756267">Atlantic</a> toward <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18">South America</a>.
In December, they made landfall at <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8678">Rio de Janeiro</a>.
From there, they sailed south along the coast, searching for a way through or around the continent.
After three months of searching (including a false start in the estuary of R&#237;o de la Plata), weather conditions forced the fleet to stop their search to wait out the winter.
They found a sheltered natural harbor at the port of Saint Julian, and remained there for five months.
Shortly after landing at <span style="color: #ff0000">St. Julian</span>, there was a mutiny attempt led by the Spanish captains Juan de Cartagena, Gaspar de Quesada and Luis de Mendoza.
Magellan barely managed to quell the mutiny, despite at one point losing control of three of his five ships to the mutineers.
Mendoza was killed during the conflict, and Magellan sentenced <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q787675">Quesada</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3738">Cartagena</a> to being beheaded and marooned, respectively.
Lower-level conspirators were made to do hard labor in chains over the winter, but later freed.

During the winter, one of the fleet's ships, the Santiago, was lost in a storm while surveying nearby waters, though no men were killed.
Following the winter, the fleet resumed their search for a passage to the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a> in October 1520.
Three days later, they found a bay which eventually led them to a strait, now known as <span style="color: #ff0000">the Strait of Magellan</span>, which allowed them passage through to the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a>. While exploring the strait, one of the remaining four ships, the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q975">San Antonio</a>, deserted the fleet, returning east to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</a>.
The fleet reached the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a> by the end of November 1520. Based on the incomplete understanding of world geography at the time, Magellan expected a short journey to <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q48">Asia</a>, perhaps taking as little as three or four days. In fact, the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a> crossing took three months and twenty days.
The long journey exhausted their supply of food and water, and around 30 men died, mostly of scurvy. Magellan himself remained healthy, perhaps because of his personal supply of preserved quince.
