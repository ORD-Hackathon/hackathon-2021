    <h1>The Tales of Magellan</h1>
    <p>The fleet left <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q29">Spain</a> on 20 September 1519, sailing west across the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q756267">Atlantic</a> toward <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18">South America</a>.</p>
    <p>In December, they made landfall at <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8678">Rio de Janeiro</a>.</p>
    <p>From there, they sailed south along the coast, searching for a way through or around the continent.</p>
    <p>After three months of searching (including a false start in the estuary of R&#237;o de la Plata), weather conditions forced the fleet to stop their search to wait out the winter.</p>
    <p>They found a sheltered natural harbor at the port of Saint Julian, and remained there for five months.</p>
    <p>Shortly after landing at <span style="color: #ff0000">St. Julian</span>, there was a mutiny attempt led by the Spanish captains Juan de <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3738">Cartagena</a>, Gaspar de <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q787675">Quesada</a> and Luis de Mendoza.</p>
    <p>Magellan barely managed to quell the mutiny, despite at one point losing control of three of his five ships to the mutineers.</p>
    <p>Mendoza was killed during the conflict, and Magellan sentenced <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q787675">Quesada</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3738">Cartagena</a> to being beheaded and marooned, respectively.</p>
    <p>Lower-level conspirators were made to do hard labor in chains over the winter, but later freed.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>During the winter, one of the fleet's ships, the Santiago, was lost in a storm while surveying nearby waters, though no men were killed.</p>
    <p>Following the winter, the fleet resumed their search for a passage to the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a> in October 1520.</p>
    <p>Three days later, they found a bay which eventually led them to a strait, now known as <span style="color: #ff0000">the Strait of Magellan</span>, which allowed them passage through to the <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q967048">Pacific</a>.</p>
