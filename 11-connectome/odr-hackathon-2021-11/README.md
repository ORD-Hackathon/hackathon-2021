# Add Google Scholar IDs to SNF researchers records in SNFp3

This is a small project part of the ODR Hackathon 2021 (Team 11 - Connectome)

*Related user story:*

As a data hub maintainer, I want to combine datasets authors information from internal records (e.g. SNFp3) with those of external platforms (e.g. VIAF, GoogleScholar, â€¦), to help disambiguating authors identity and enrich the knowledge graph.

## Content

Data are located in the ``data/`` directory. It contains a publicly available sample of the SNF p3 records downloaded from http://p3.snf.ch/Pages/DataAndDocumentation.aspx.

The notebooks/sandbox.ipynb contains python code to test approaches and propose solutions based on the Scholarly API (https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/).

This is a Renku project, see here for details: https://renku.readthedocs.io
